Credit Card Fraud Detection System
Overview
The Credit Card Fraud Detection System is a software application designed to identify and prevent fraudulent transactions in real-time. This system utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze patterns and detect anomalies in credit card transactions, helping financial institutions and cardholders protect against unauthorized activities.

Features
Real-time Monitoring:

The system monitors credit card transactions in real-time, allowing for immediate detection of suspicious activities.
Machine Learning Algorithms:

Utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms, such as supervised and unsupervised learning, to analyze transaction patterns and detect anomalies.
Pattern Recognition:

Identifies normal spending patterns for each cardholder and raises alerts for transactions that deviate significantly from these patterns.
Behavioral Analysis:

Incorporates behavioral analysis to understand the typical spending behavior of individual cardholders and detect any deviations or unusual activities.
User Authentication:

Implements multi-factor authentication and biometric verification methods to enhance the security of transactions.
Alert System:

Generates alerts and notifications for suspicious transactions, allowing quick response and investigation by the appropriate authorities.
Historical Data Analysis:

Analyzes historical transaction data to identify trends and patterns associated with fraudulent activities.
Adaptive Learning:

Incorporates adaptive learning mechanisms to continuously improve the model's accuracy over time as it encounters new data and patterns.

Configuration
Model Configuration:

Adjust model parameters and configuration settings in the config.yml file.
Data Source:

Connect the system to the appropriate data source (database, API, etc.) by modifying the data source configuration in config.yml.
Alert Settings:

Customize alert thresholds and notification preferences in the config.yml file.
Usage
Input:

Provide credit card transaction data to the system for analysis.
Monitoring:

Monitor the system output for alerts and notifications.
Investigation:

Investigate flagged transactions to confirm or deny fraudulent activities.
Feedback Loop:

Continuously update the system with feedback to enhance its learning and detection capabilities.
